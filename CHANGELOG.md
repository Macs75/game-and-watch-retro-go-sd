# Changelog

## What's New

### Version 1.1.1
- Fix compatibility with some microSD cards models (and probably fixes some rare issues with some allready supported cards).
  This is also requiring an update of the bootloader to v1.0.7 (or later).

To update firmware you can download [gnw_bootloader.bin ](https://github.com/sylverb/game-and-watch-bootloader/releases/latest/download/gnw_bootloader.bin) and [gnw_bootloader_0x08032000.bin](https://github.com/sylverb/game-and-watch-bootloader/releases/latest/download/gnw_bootloader_0x08032000.bin) and put them in the root folder of your sd card with `retro-go_update.bin`. After booting the console, the standard update will start and bootloader will also be updated. Check "Bootloader Update Steps" section of README.md for more details, but be aware that a bootloader update failure will require jtag connection to rewrite the bootloader.
